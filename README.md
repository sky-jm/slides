## How to compile static HTML
1) Install [Marp](https://marp.app/)
2) Make sure it's in PATH
3) Run `marp <markdown filename>

## Tips
While you are editing you might want to use `-w` to watch for changes in the Markdown file and automatically recompile.
On your other screen you can open up the HTML file in your browser and it automatically refreshes once the recompile is done.

```zsh
➜  streams git:(main) ✗ marp -w streams.md
[  INFO ] Converting 1 markdown...
[  INFO ] streams.md => streams.html
[  INFO ] [Watch mode] Start watching...
```
